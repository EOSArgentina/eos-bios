# Action - `{{ regaccount }}`

## Description

The intent of the `regaccount` action is to register an EOS account using the stored information {{ Ethereum address }} and {{ balance }} from the `eosio.unregd` contract, after verifying the submitted Ethereum {{ signature }}.

As an authorized party, I {{ signer }} wish to create an account {{ account }} on the EOS chain with ID: aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906, accessible with EOS public key {{ eos_pubkey_str }} by submitting cryptographic proof {{ signature }} corresponding to the {{ Ethereum address }}.

As signer, I stipulate that if I am not the beneficial owner of these tokens, I have proof that Iâ€™ve been authorized to take this action by their beneficial owner(s).

In case of dispute, all cases should be brought to the EOS Core Arbitration Forum at https://eoscorearbitration.io/.
